Decide on a proper interface for setting the colours to use. Maybe just pass
a hash to the constructor.

Finer grained (than just the level) highlightling system. More like colorize
and ccze.

Category include and exclude filters for what to log.

Message formatting. Keep it simple put powerful by usng a sub as the formatter.

 formatter => sub {
    my $time = localtime;
    "$0 ($$) [$time] $level: $category - $msg";
 }
